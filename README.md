# hello-world


Hi People from everywhere!..
I'm Josu√©, but you can call me Josh.
I started teaching myself how to code about 2 years ago.
Sincz then, I gradually became addicted to computers and coding.
I love Python which I consider like my native language.
I also like web technologies and started learning html, css, and javascript few months ago.
..and by the way.., I'm a pro linux. I started my coding journey on ubuntu, and switched this year to debian.
So hzre I am.. aiming to share my projects with other passionate programmers, and collaborate on tons of projects..
Peace to ya all!..
